  <p><b>In Brief:</b> Cosyne is great, but people can't attend in person for climate, visa, financial, or personal reasons. Cosyne
  talks are streamed on youtube, but watching days of talks on your laptop is as agonising way to an aneurism. Cosyne
  Viewing Parties aim to offer a third way: gathering regionally with others to provide partial conference benefits at
  partial costs. This page provides motivation, and information on how to attend a Viewing Party or host your own.</p>

  <p><b>Some Motivation:</b> Flying round the world to attend a conference is not always possible. Cost,
  visa restrictions, and personal responsibilities can make such a trip impossible. Further, flights contribute
   around <a href = https://ourworldindata.org/global-aviation-emissions>2.5% of yearly CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</a>,
  but, unlike most other major sources of emissions, there is no feasible green drop-in replacement for flying. This
  makes reducing flying a key part of almost all realistic net-zero plans.</p>

  <p><b>The Idea:</b> Viewing Parties will run alongside the main conference in Lisbon. They will allow people to gather,
  capturing some of the advantages of an in-person conference, while making logistics easier and greener. The details are
  flexible: at it's simplest, it might just involve hiring a room and screening the talks for an audience who can then discuss
  what they see. More elaborate versions might draw people from across a large area (e.g. all of South Africa, or the Eastern US)
  and host poster sessions, social events, or additional discussions alongside talk screenings. This has already worked
  for <a href = "https://ellisunconference2023.github.io/">ICML</a>, <a href = https://2025.ccneuro.org/local-meetups/>CCN</a>,
    and <a href = https://eurips.cc/>NeurIPS</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Host:</b>Hosting can be easy! Simply book a room at your local institution and screen the talks. Additional efforts
  that might improve the expeirence include coffee/food, a poster session, organised social events, or additional panel discussions.
