  <p><b>In Brief:</b> Cosyne is the preeminent computational neuroscience conference, but a variety of factors limit in-person attendance. Cosyne
  talks are streamed on youtube, but watching days of talks on your laptop is an agonising way to an aneurism. Cosyne is making
    videos available online, which offers a third way: regional gatherings that provide partial conference benefits at partial costs
    This page provides motivation, and information on how to attend a Cosyne Viewing Party or host your own.</p>

  <p><b>Some Motivation:</b> Costs, visa restrictions, and personal responsibilities can make flying round the world to attend a conference impossible. Further, flights contribute
   around <a href = https://ourworldindata.org/global-aviation-emissions>2.5% of yearly CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</a> (and their proportion of warming is even higher, due to contrails and the altitude of emission),
  but, unlike most other major sources of emissions, there is no feasible green drop-in replacement for flying. This
  makes reducing flying a key part of almost all realistic net-zero plans.</p>

  <p><b>The Idea:</b> Viewing Parties will run alongside the main conference in Lisbon. They will allow people to gather,
  capturing some of the advantages of an in-person conference, while making logistics easier and greener. The details are
  flexible: at it's simplest, it can involve hiring a room and screening the talks for an audience who can then discuss
  what they see. More elaborate versions might draw people from across a large area (e.g. all of South Africa, or the Eastern US)
  and host poster sessions, social events, or additional discussions alongside talk screenings. This has already worked
  for <a href = "https://ellisunconference2023.github.io/">ICML</a>, <a href = https://2025.ccneuro.org/local-meetups/>CCN</a>,
    and <a href = https://eurips.cc/>NeurIPS</a>.</p>




  <p><b>Host:</b> Hosting can be easy! Simply book a room at your local institution and screen the talks (syncing your screening with the main meeting isn't necessary if time difference is an issue). Additional efforts
  that might improve the experience include coffee/food, a poster session, organised social events, or additional panel discussions.
