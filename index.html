	  <p> Welcome, web surfer, to my little corner of the interwebs.</p>
    <p> Perhaps you arrived here with curiosity about my professional life? </p>
    <ul>
      <li style = "margin-bottom: 0em">I am a PhD student at the Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, part of UCL. </li>
      <li style = "margin: 0.25em">I used to be an intern at OIST (Okinawa Instute of Science and Technology) in Prof. Eric de Schutter's group. I worked on biologically-plausible reinforcement learning.</li>
      <li style = "margin: 0.25em">I attended the 2020 Imbizo computational neuroscience summer school.</li>
      <li style = "margin: 0.25em">I first met theoretical neuroscience working for Prof. Cengiz Pehlevan at Harvard. I worked on theoretical olfaction.</li>
      <li style = "margin: 0.25em">I used to be a condensed matter physicist, and when I first moved to Harvard I worked on acoustic metamaterial mimics of condensed matter systems in Prof. Jenny Hoffman's lab.</li>
      <li style = "margin: 0.25em">I did my undergrad in physics at Cambridge.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> If you are in to this kind of stuff may I point you to a collection of my research projects? Or my CV? Or my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GyVPmtYAAAAJ&hl=en">Google Scholar Profile</a>?</p>
    <p> However, I mainly became a proud website owner in order to host wacky things on the internet, you can find these in the 'Not-so-serious Things' section. </p>
