	  <p>Scientific projects during my PhD:</p>

	  <ul>
		  <li style = "margin-bottom: 1em">Finding a Circuit's Inductive Bias, TLDR: designed a tool to learn tasks that a
			  circuit you're interested in finds easy to learn.

			  How do we generalise?

		  </li>

		  <li style = "margin-bottom: 1em">Unsupervised Decoding of Mouse Dreams, TLDR: adapted a Bayesian spike-sequence detection algorithm to
			  recover the content of mice's thoughts during sleep.

			  <p>Emmett Thompson in the SWC, with the Stephenson-Jones lab, measured the neural activity of mice as they performed a stereotyped action (like
			  typing your password), and as they slept. We adapted a very nice recent hierarchical Bayesian point-process algorithm, <a href="https://github.com/lindermanlab/PPSeq.jl">PPSeq</a>,
			  in an effort to spot patterns in the neural data (i.e. every time the mouse leans this way these neurons activate like this), then go find the same
			  patterns in the data while the mouse was sleeping. We found evidence that while the mouse is sleeping the same patterns are replaying,
			  suggesting the mouse might be thinking about the actions it spent all day doing!</p>

			  <p>Now the experimental team is looking to see what role this replay plays. It could be functional, like if you practice the piano then go to sleep, you'll
			  be better when you wake up. This could be because your brain is replaying the patterns it learned during the day. This can all be tested with fancy optogenetic
			  tools and the like. Expect news soon!</p>

			  <p>The theory side of this was a very fun collaboration with <a href="https://github.com/TomGeorge1234/">Tom George</a>, <a href="https://clementinedomine.github.io/">Clementine Domine</a>, and Rodrigo Carrasco-Davis.</p>
		  </li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>Between undergrad and PhD:</p>
		<ul>
			<li style = "margin-bottom: 1em"> <a href = "./html/bilateral_olfaction.html">Bilateral Olfaction</a>, TLDR: Analysed olfactory responses to odours in one nostril and used them to build a model of how two hemispheres communicate.
				<p>My first foray into theoretical neuroscience, why do we have two nostrils?! I analysed neural from the olfactory cortex as odours
			were smelt in the nostril on the same or different side, and asked whether they were different. They weren't very, which was a puzzle given the random scrambling that's supposed to happen in the olfactory system, so we
			build a model to explain this!</p></li>
			<li style = "margin-bottom: 1em"> <a href = "./html/okinawa_research.html">Bio-Plausible Hierarchical Reinforcment Learning</a>, TLDR: adapted some hierarchical RL control algorithms to be bio-plausible.

				<p>My project in Okinawa with Sergio Veduzco-Flores, we adapted hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithms
			to work biologically-plausibly! These are two algorithms controlling an arm type thing: the top one (the manager) says 'get the arm here' and the bottom one (worker) says 'okay boss, moving muscles to get arm here'. The manager
			learns to choose good instructions so the complete agents succeeds, the worker learns to do what the manager says!</p></li>
			<li style = "margin: 1em"><p><a href = "./html/metamaterials.html">Acoustic Metamaterials</a>, TLDR: made an acoustic metamaterial mimic of bilayer graphene.
				<p>I used to be a condensed matter physicist, interested in understanding the weird ways large collections of atoms start behaving.
				Often these are funky quantum systems, colder than outer space, carefully isolated from the outside world. But! Surprisingly, many of these interesting phenomena have analogues in much simpler systems. The
				equations which govern electrons have similarities to those that govern simple waves (e.g. sound), so you can make analogues of weird electronic effects using sound waves. This is (A) cool, (B) allows you to study
				the same phenomena but at room temperature with nothing more complex than a lattice of iron pillars, a speaker, and a microphone, (C) allows technological transfer, either making better acoustic devices thanks to
				the last century of condensed matter physics, or using acoustics to rapidly prototype the very fiddly little quantum devices in simple acoustics first, then try them in quantum world!</p>

			I developed just such an acoustic mimic of a current system of much interest, van der Waals materials, and their superstar family member (superstar because it superconducts, which is a holy grail of condensed matter physics), magic angle twisted bilayer graphene.</li>
